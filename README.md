# zref-vario

**Extended LaTeX page cross-references with varioref and zref-clever**

`zref-vario` offers a compatibility layer for `varioref` to be used alongside
`zref-clever`.  It provides "`\z...`" counterparts to `varioref`'s main
reference commands, each of which essentially does some (scoped) setup for
`varioref`, then calls the original one.

The released version of this package is available [from
CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/zref-vario).

[Documentation](https://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/zref-vario/zref-vario-doc.pdf).
