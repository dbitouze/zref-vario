## v0.1.9 (2023-08-15)

### Changed
- `zref-vario` no longer delays the loading of `varioref`.  So there's no
  longer need to load the latter separately but, on the other hand,
  `zref-vario` becomes subject to the same load order restrictions as
  `varioref`.
- Use `\label` instead of `\zlabel` in regression tests.
