# zref-vario

**Extended LaTeX page cross-references with varioref and zref-clever**

## [v0.1.0-alpha]

- Initial release.
- `zref-vario` offers a compatibility layer for `varioref` to be used
  alongside `zref-clever`.  It provides "`\z...`" counterparts to `varioref`'s
  main reference commands, each of which essentially does some (scoped) setup
  for `varioref`, then calls the original one.
