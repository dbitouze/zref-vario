## v0.1.5 (2022-07-08)

### Added
- `\zvsetup` for package options settings.
- `pageprop` option to set the reference property used for page comparisons.
  This option lifts `varioref`'s restriction of depending on the arabic page
  numbering to distinguish between nearby and far away references.  See the
  user manual for details.
